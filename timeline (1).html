                not just houses and skyscrapers (thanks Civil Engineering!), but also a

            <p class="para-style">
                Ever heard of a civil engineer turning digital marketer? Well, that was me! I traded in
                blueprints for marketing strategies and dived headfirst into the exciting world of making things visible
                online.
                Worked for a Singaporean company remotely from India.

                The digital world was cool, but a creative itch started nagging at me.
                Enter the fascinating world of User Experience (UX) Design! I co-founded "Urban Tribe," a
                print-on-demand
                e-commerce website, where I got to combine my newfound design skills with my love for
                making things (this time, awesome t-shirts!).

                Bonjour, France! I moved to the beautiful city of Grenoble to pursue a Master's degree in Luxury Brand
                Management.While soaking up all things luxury, I also kept my design skills sharp by working as a

                for a remote event management startup called "The Plannerss."I also landed a UX design
                and research internship at Amadeus, a leading travel IT company. A perfect blend of my
                interests – design, travel, and a touch of luxury!
